----------------------------- Finding the Higgs Boson --------------------------
Solving the problem by fitting Breit-Wigner function to data and minimizing on its chi^2
The initial guesses on mass = 125.3, width = 3.5, amplitude = 6.1
The results of the minimization routine were:
Mass = 125.972186682566, Width = 2.0863351254216, Amplitude = 9.87623199292563, Nsteps = 76
HIGGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOUND!
The resulting fit to the data can be seen in figure higgsfit_fig.pdf
