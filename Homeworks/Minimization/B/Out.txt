----------------------------- Finding the Higgs Boson --------------------------
Solving the problem by fitting Breit-Wigner function to data and minimizing on its chi^2
The initial guesses on mass = 125.3, width = 3.5, amplitude = 6.1
The results of the minimization routine were:
Mass = 1248.07258967568, Width = 18134.0900510334, Amplitude = 2875.33164644174, Nsteps = 59
The fit to find Higgs was unsuccesful :(
The resulting fit to the data can be seen in figure higgsfit_fig.pdf
