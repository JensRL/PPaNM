The Runge-Kutta 45 stepper and driver is tested for a damped oscillator
The algorithm now stores the solutions in two generic lists for easy utilization
The final solutions are theta=-0.382375272483515 and omega=1.43159940292407
The results are seen in the plot DampedOsc_fig.pdf using the outputted genlists
