--------------- Testing the implemented Artificial Neural Network --------------
Testing is carried out with respects to interpolation of a function
Activation function = Gaussian Wavelet, testing function f = 3*x+x^2*sin(x)
The Artificial Neural Network completed the interpolation successfully!
For smooth interpolation the number of hidden neurons required was = 15
The result of the interpolation is seen in figure ANNinterp_fig.pdf
