--------------- Testing the implemented Artificial Neural Network --------------
The implementation now allows for derivative and integral of interpolant
Testing is carried out with respects to interpolation of the same function as before
Activation function = Gaussian Wavelet, testing function f = 3*x+x^2*sin(x)
Gaussian Wavelet has analytic derivative and integral => good choice for activation function
The Artificial Neural Network completed the interpolation successfully!
For smooth interpolation the number of hidden neurons required was = 15
The result of the interpolation is seen in figure ANNinterp_fig.pdf
The resulting derivatives and integrals are now also indicated
