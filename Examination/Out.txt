FOR FULL PROJECT DESCRIPTION REFER TO THE README.txt FILE
The Berrut B1 rational function interpolation algorithm is tested
Multiple comparisons with the cubic- and quadratic spline algorithms have been made
The oscillatory behavior due to the Runge phenomenon has generally been reduced by the Berrut approach
Multiple test cases were considered and can be inspected in the outputted pdf figures
